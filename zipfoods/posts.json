The customers were speaking in Tagalog. And the food…. ♥ Oh my! There’s isaw ng manok (chicken intestines), fish balls, kwek-kwek (quail eggs cooked in the orange breading you see above), betamax (grilled chicken blood), and MY FAVORITE isaw ng baboy (pig intestines; shown in the picture above). AHHH. It’s like my childhood all over again. :) Some people would probably say “YUCK” to these types of food.I mean, I guess it’s understandable.But if you ever get a chance, try them ? :) They are great protein sources! And most of them are REALLY REALLY REALLY delicious, especially if you pair them with the sweet sauce or the vinegar sauce that the vendors make. :D So yea.Filipino Pride. "

I initially thought we’d go somewhere far from campus… but we went to the Commons, which is just behind Farley. At first I was kinda sad cuz I really thought we were going off campus. But at the end of the trip, I was really glad I went.Putting on the skis could actually be complicated, especially when there’s ice stuck inside. If that ever happens, pour some hot water on it! Hah anyway, I fell a lot of times and even crashed into a tree. It’s okay though. It’s all part of the experience. :’)"

But around the same time, we would visit my mom at the cemetery to celebrate her birthday and “All Souls Day.” We would go there super early in the morning (before the sun rises) to find a good spot next to my mom’s because the place would get so crowded. We would set up a tent, settle all the food the we brought on a “banig”, and eat as one big happy family. :) my cousins would even bring a kite, cards, or badminton so we do something together. #missinghome That’s how I grew up spending that time of the year. But throughout my college experience, Bowdoin showed me that there are other ways to celebrate! Stay classy! ¡Adios!"

Haha But I take it back. :) So this trip was very educational! I learned a little bit about Henry Huntington, THE MAN… THE FOUNDER of The Huntington. In his later years, He eventually married his uncle’s widow, Arabella Huntington, and together they transformed the place. They were fascinated by books, art, and gardens. So today, The Huntington has a library, where you can find the Gutenberg Bible, a European art gallery, and about 12 different botanical gardens, such as the Japanese Garden, the Desert Garden, and the Jungle Garden. My favorite part would probably be the bonsai trees. I could imagine their trunks as tiny bodies of dinosaurs! Ahhhh. So cool. I also really liked the Jungle Garden ‘cause it made me feel like I was in the Hunger Games. Haha oh, and the Children’s Garden was very adorable, especially ‘cause of the water fountains, and the kids running around. :’) The mausoleum, where both Henry and Arabella are buried, was also pretty cool. It was such a beautiful day! Plus, I got my exercise for the year. Haha I might have walked about 6 miles that day. :’)"

If you find yourself driving around SF city one day, make sure to come by Lombard St. It’s amazing! <3"

Yosemite National Park is a jaw-dropper. ♥  It was probably the highlight of my first road trip ever and I would love to go back so HMU? :D Unfortunately, we didn’t get to spend a lot of time at the park. I think we only stayed there for about three hours and we  spent half of the time taking pictures. haha If I were to go back soon, I would take my dad. One, because he’s my dad and he probably would cover the cost of the trip. So, no need for me to spend some dineros. :D Two, because I want him to take some time to relax and enjoy life. Plus, it could be a great bonding moment for both of us!"

I remember staying up late at night on a school day just to read more pages. I have not seen the movie so I’m not sure how different it is from the book. But yea, I recommend the book. The best part about it though was that it made me look up videos of hatching turtles on YouTube. :) Lots of people go there to take pictures, film music videos, buy or read some books, listen to some educational talks, or just hangout. There’s also an art gallery. Oh and some of the sculptures around the store are amazing. In other words, the Last Bookstore is a really cool space. And it’s not that far! Just take the red line to Pershing Square and you’re almost there. haha"

And so on July 14, 2015, I went there along with eleven other cool Filipinos. ;) I would say that my first slide, Neptune’s Fury, made me a bit more courageous. Although I was nervous at first, it felt really nice. The water splashing on my face. Friends screaming. The unpredictable turns and sways of the purple tube in complete darkness.  Ahhhh. So good. :) Then we went to the the Bermuda Triangle. Then the High Extreme, which was an INTENSE workout because the walk to get up there took longer than the slide down. HMMM… They should probably invest in an elevator. Then the Lily Pads, which I didn’t really like that much. It just made my arms and my upper body sore the next day. But no complaints. At least I’m getting muscles. :) Then the Ragin’ Racer, where I lost. BADLY. Then the Wave Cove and then the Amazon Adventure, also known as the Lazy River–one of my faves too."

My friends and I went to the state park during prospie weekend just ‘cause one of us has access to a car. It was such a lovely day, not too cold, not too warm. We walked around a trail and took pictures. We looked for the geocache box, which had lots of random things in it including a pine cone, a business card, and a coin. We also spend some time admiring the water… The trees. And the rocks! AHHHH. So much appreciation for nature’s beauty."

Hehe 😅 Plus, the drive back from Rockland to school was about an hour so we didn’t really have enough time. But I took lots of pictures and jumped from one rock to the next. Andddd, I was with my friends. That’s all that matters! On our walk, we saw couples and families. There was even a wedding at the park near it! I guess Breakwater Lighthouse is a place of love! (so cheesy haha)"
